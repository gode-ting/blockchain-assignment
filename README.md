## Commands

Any of these commands should be run from a terminal where current working directory in the terminal is the root of the project.

`npm i`/`npm install`: should be run first time you work with the project, or if you're missing dependencies someone else added to package.json.

`npm run dev`: start a node server in development. That is, Nodemon will run it and restart automatically when changes are made.

`npm run start`: start a node server. Should be used for production.

`npm run test`: Runs specified mocha tests (none setup yet)

### ECMAscript

In general people use ECMAscript to add better syntax to JavaScript projects, and improved functionality.

### Arrow functions

An **arrow function** is just like a default javascript function, but with a slightly different syntax. It's mostly used within other functions, and not to declare a function:

```javascript
	app.listen(port, () => {
		console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
	});
```

**Regular function:**
```javascript
	app.listen(port, function () {
		console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
	});
```

### var, let and const

**var** is the way to declare a variable, which are subject to change.

**let** is the "new" ECMAscript way of doing this.

An example of **var** or **let** could be:

```javascript
let counter = 0;
while(counter < 10) {counter++;}
```

**const** is the way to declare a variable, which are NOT subject to change. This makes it easier for you later, or other developers, to know that the variable are not going to pÃ¥ manipulated later.

An example of **const** could be:

```javascript
const subModuleRequirement = require('iAmASubModule');
```

### Require

Using require is the way you add modules to a module. This can be used to inject both module-dependencies from NPM registry, but also local modules.

Usually you declare these as a **const** as they most likely are not going to be manipulated/changed. 

```javascript
// load from dependecies - node_modules folder
const express = require('express');
// load local module
const indexRouter = require('./routes/index.js');
```
