## ECMAscript

In general people use ECMAscript to add better syntax to JavaScript projects, and improved functionality.

## Arrow functions

An **arrow function** is just like a default javascript function, but with a slightly different syntax. It's mostly used within other functions, and not to declare a function:

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

**Regular function:**

```javascript
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

## var, let and const

**var** is the way to declare a variable, which are subject to change.

**let** is the "new" ECMAscript way of doing this.

An example of **var** or **let** could be:

```javascript
let counter = 0;
while(counter < 10) {counter++;}
```

**const** is the way to declare a variable, which are NOT subject to change. This makes it easier for you later, or other developers, to know that the variable are not going to pÃ¥ manipulated later.

An example of **const** could be:

```javascript
const subModuleRequirement = require('iAmASubModule');
```

## Require

Using require is the way you add modules to a module. This can be used to inject both module-dependencies from NPM registry, but also local modules.

Usually you declare these as a **const** as they most likely are not going to be manipulated/changed.

```javascript
// load from dependecies - node_modules folder
const express = require('express');
// load local module
const indexRouter = require('./routes/index.js');
```

## module.exports

[https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/).

module.exports is the way to export content of one file to another. 

**foo.js**

```javascript
let fooArray = [];
module.exports = fooArray;
```

**bar.js**

```javascript
let fooArray = require('./foo');
fooArray.push('bar');
console.log(fooArray);
// [ 'bar' ]
```
