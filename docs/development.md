# Development

## Commands

Any of these commands should be run from a terminal where current working directory in the terminal is the root of the project.

`npm i`/`npm install`: should be run first time you work with the project, or if you're missing dependencies someone else added to package.json.

`npm run dev`: start a node server in development. That is, Nodemon will run it and restart automatically when changes are made.

`npm run start`: start a node server. Should be used for production.

`npm run test`: Runs specified mocha tests (none setup yet)
